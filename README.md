# AirBnb_Price_prediction
Created in collaborations with: Stephanie Kwan on Google Colab
In this project, we analyze a Paris airbnb dataset found from a Kaggle dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/fermatsavant/airbnb-dataset-of-barcelona-city) that linked to a website of many other datasets (http://tomslee.net/category/airbnb-data). We chose data from Paris in July 2017 in order to control its size. First ,we analyzed the characteristics of the dataset and the general observable trends to select variables to use. Our goal is to utilize different models (such as linear Regression) to predict the price of a listing on airbnb. After training these models, we assess them using MSE and other measures. We found that among the features how many people a listing can accommodate was one of the most indicative features.
